Add the Python script! There's about 30 lines of Python that ran on the Raspberry Pi and marshalled the raw outputs from the Arduino, turning them into requests on the meteor.js app. I didn't grab the code at the time, but John's going to copy it off.

The [pyserial](http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/) library was used for reading serial output from the Arduino.
